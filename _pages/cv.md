Education
======
* M.S. in Computer Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, 2024.09-2027.06 (expected)
* B.S. in Software Engineering, Zhengzhou University, 2020.09-2024.06

Project Experience
======
* 2023.09-2024.2: **Stranger Detection System for Laboratory**
  * Person in Charge
  * Developed the front-end interface using Vue.js, implementing real-time monitoring, alert push notifications, and historical record querying.
  * Constructed the back-end service based on the Spring Boot framework to handle front-end requests, including video stream processing, face recognition result comparison, and alert generation and push.
  * Responsible for server selection, configuration, and deployment, using Docker containerization for rapid service deployment and horizontal scaling.
  * Built and trained a face recognition model using PyTorch. The system runs stably with a recognition accuracy of over 98%.

* 2022.09-2023.4: **Driver Abnormal Behavior Detection Project**
  * Core Member
  * The team designed and implemented a driver abnormal behavior detection model based on Yolo v5, used TensorRT to accelerate model inference, compressed the model using a knowledge distillation algorithm based on instance conditions, and deployed the model on edge terminal devices.
  * The trained model achieved an accuracy of 94.78% on the validation set.
  * Responsible for model building, the entire front-end and back-end development process, and project deployment.
  * The project won the national third prize in the Computer Design Competition.

* 2021.05-2024.06: **Application of Decision Tree and Feedforward Neural Network Algorithms in Coordinating Multi-Agent Players**
  * Person in Charge
  * Evaluated the positions of our players using a feedforward neural network algorithm to obtain corresponding scores.
  * Combined with information such as the degree of noise affecting each player on the field and the player's status, a decision tree algorithm was used to determine the best playing strategy for the players.
  * Without considering the position changes of players in different formations, the team's winning rate was improved by 8.7%.
  * This project won the first prize in the 3D simulation group of the China Robot Competition and ROBOCUP Robot World Cup China Tournament.
