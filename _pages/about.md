I am Songxin Qu (Jack), a dedicated AI Engineer and Software Developer specializing in large language models (LLMs) and their real-world applications. With a strong foundation in software engineering and ongoing graduate studies at the University of Science and Technology of China, I focus on advancing LLM research, fine-tuning, and scalable deployment. My work bridges cutting-edge AI advancements with robust full-stack development, leveraging frameworks like PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and distributed training tools to deliver high-impact solutions.



Technical Expertise
======
My core strengths lie in LLM fine-tuning, model optimization, and end-to-end AI system design. I excel in adapting foundational models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) for domain-specific tasks through parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA and QLoRA, achieving performance improvements while minimizing computational costs. My experience spans:
1. Custom LLM Development: Fine-tuning models for specialized NLP tasks using frameworks like DeepSpeed and PyTorch Lightning, with a focus on low-rank adaptation and quantization.

2. Distributed Training: Optimizing training pipelines for multi-GPU/TPU environments, leveraging Megatron-LM and NVIDIA NeMo for efficient large-scale parallelism.

3. Deployment & Scalability: Containerizing LLM inference services with Docker, designing RESTful APIs for seamless integration, and deploying latency-sensitive applications using vLLM or TensorRT-LLM.

4. Evaluation & Alignment: Implementing rigorous evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) and alignment strategies (RLHF, DPO) to ensure model robustness and ethical compliance.

Career Vision
======
I am driven to push the boundaries of generative AI by solving complex challenges in model efficiency, multi-modal integration, and real-time inference. Whether refining billion-parameter models for industry-specific use cases or architecting MLOps pipelines for continuous learning, I aim to deliver solutions that balance technical rigor with practical usability. My goal is to contribute to open-source LLM ecosystems while advancing enterprise-grade AI applications in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Featured Projects
------
1. Domain-Specific LLM Fine-tuning: Adapted LLaMA-2 for a legal document analysis system, reducing hallucination rates by 18% through curated datasets and RLHF.

2. Efficient Training Pipelines: Built a distributed fine-tuning framework using Hugging Face Accelerate, achieving 2.3x faster convergence on proprietary datasets.

3. Edge LLM Deployment: Optimized a Mistral-7B variant for real-time inference on NVIDIA Jetson platforms, achieving 45ms/token latency via TensorRT-LLM.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
